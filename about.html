    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>My name is Jin Tai Ahn. I'm from Highland, UT and am currently working on my
      Bachelor's degree in Bioinformatics at Brigham Young University (two more semesters let's
      gooo). I enjoy spending time with family and friends, and especially love time out with
      my wife and our dog Haru. When we're not outside on walks, bouldering at the climbing gym,
      or throwing tricks on the gymnastics floor, you can find us inside playing video games and watching anime.</p>
